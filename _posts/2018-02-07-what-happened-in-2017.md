Oops, 2017 went by without a blog post! What happened?

Not a lot...

- The interactive Brat shell works again!
- More unboxed operations on numbers
- Single-quoted backslashes finally parse correctly
- More tracking of types during compilation
- Symbols (`:blah`) are now immutable, again
- Create prototype objects on demand
- This works: `x.y = {}()`
- Fix nested comments and semicolons in comments 
- Updated LuaJIT


Overall, Brat is another year older, and a little bit faster!
