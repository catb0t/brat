### PREREQUISITES

To build and run Brat, you will need:

+ A C compiler

### INSTALLATION

There are two scripts in the to facilitate building Brat: build.sh and install.sh

First run build.sh:

  ./build.sh

If all goes well, you will have a local version of Brat which you can run.

Try running the tests via:

  ./brat test/test.brat

To install to your system:

  sudo ./install.sh

The default location is in /usr. If you want to install Brat somewhere else, you can specify it as an argument to install.sh:

  sudo ./install.sh /usr/local

To uninstall, should the need ever arise (unlikely):

  sudo ./uninstall.sh

### Syntax highlighting

For VIM, copy extras/brat.vim to ~/.vim/syntax/

and then add this to ~/.vimrc:

au BufNewFile,BufRead *.brat set filetype=brat
